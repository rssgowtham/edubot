Before the evolution of Search Engine Technology, people used to search
information in books. This method takes lots of effort and time. In later
years, when Search Engine Algorithms came into use it was made easy to
find information through the Internet. Now-a-days, it is a time
consuming task for typing a sentence of words in a search engine. But
we have no alternatives for this. In this case, “EDU-BOT WITH IMAGE,
AUDIO AND TEXT PROCESSING” comes to an aid.
Although the concepts of image to text processing and audio to text
conversion have already been developed, taking a step forward by adding
some features, we can just take a snap of the text or record an audio and
retrieve the results in PDF format through an Interface. Our project
includes two phases. First phase is, the image or audio or even plain text
input is taken from the user through any medium such as WhatsApp.
This input is converted into text. If the input is image, this conversion
process includes recognizing characters in text using Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) Technology and Deep Learning Algorithms. If the
input is audio, the conversion is made by first converting the .ogg file
to .wav file and then converting it to text using the pydub and speechrecognition packages. This recognized text is then converted into a
sequence of characters. According to the user's instructions, the
processed text will be either forwarded to the search engine or will be
translated in the back end. In the second phase, if the user selects a
search option, the most optimized results from the search engine are
extracted and formatted into a PDF file. This PDF file is dispatched to the
User’s medium through an Interface. If the user selects the translation,
the text will be translated to any other language asked by the client and
is sent to him.
